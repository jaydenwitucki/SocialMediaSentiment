"I stopped any kind of intoxicants when my wife first got pregnant, and our youngest (of 6) finally moved out the year weed went legal in my country. 

Upon learning how ridiculously strong marijuana has become, I decided to try to use it to supplement my painkillers which I take for various injuries gained while doing stuff like being in multiple rig-blowouts, and getting t-boned (on my side) by a fully loaded grain truck.
 
I found a strategy that works for me (flabbergasting myself with vaped hash oil during pain flare ups) to the point that I often return my actual painkillers to the pharmacy without even having opened them. 



I fucking hate opiates, I hate the trade of itchy nausea and false hunger combined with constipation in exchange for for less pain, I hate how I can tell the pain's still there but it feels spackled over like throwing a blanket over a grizzly, I really hate the impending dread of diminishing returns, and I hate how the advice I got from doctors for dealing with side effects is to take them regularly.

And I really, fucking *really* hate being dependent upon a stigmatized medicine that any doctor can take away with a word. That's the part that bothers me the most, and it's what drives me to give back full bottles, I don't know if anybody keeps track of that stuff but I feel like I'm wracking up a massive score. 


The weed isn't magical, it doesn't always work, what it does is it distracts me. 

The neat thing is that I don't need a pretense for weed. I don't need a doctors card, the supply is not finite, I can experiment at will to see what if anything works for me, and what doesn't, and I have no reason to try to accept poor results simply to keep ingesting marijuana, since I can do that at will anyways.

"During the live press conference, the sheriff said that they believe there were 9 people on board, a pilot and 8 passengers. He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said “imagine finding out a loved one has died through social media”, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind.

Edit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin):
they don’t know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and they’re working hard to get answers.
They don’t know what happened, they don’t know where the helicopter took off, they don’t know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is “about an acre”, that’s also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire.

Honestly, it was him constantly repeating that they don’t know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about “taking an hour to extinguish” - but again, that’s because of the magnesium.

After that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off.

It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.

FLIGHT TOWER AUDIO
We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.
At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.
However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 185mph.",positive,2

So my mom and I have a tradition that we watch every jeopardy episode together. I grew up watching Jeopardy. Before the show starts, we always guess what colour tie Alex is going to wear. It's been a silly game we've played between us for years.

A few years ago for Christmas we decided to send him his own red tie with maple leafs on it since Alex is Canadian (so are we) and he actually wore it on the show. We read a [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/alex-trebek-stylist-phil-wayne) on it and apparently he wanted to work it into the show. We weren't expecting him to wear it on the show, we just wanted to share how much joy it gave my mom and I each night.

I'm really saddened by his passing. I applaud him for continuing the show even when he wasn't in good health. He was a really good man, made a ton of people so happy and did a lot for the trivia community. RIP Alex &lt;3

Edit: For anyone curious, [here's him in the tie](https://imgur.com/a/LELie9F). This was January 2016.

His charisma as the Jeopardy host (and the best game show host ever) was a factor in me becoming so interested in learning about anything as a kid and that has extended to adulthood. He will be missed.",positive,2

"It's a shame but, I think he lived a very fulfilling life. He got an illness that usually kills most people in an incredibly short time, and then he lived out to a pretty healthy and average lifespan. All while being one of the most famous scientists of all-time, a person that was an inspiration and got so many others interested in science. 

I have nothing but respect for him, I don't think history will ever forget this man.",positive,2

Damn. 

Rest in peace.",positive,2
"I was thinking the other day that I've been too young to see much history, all these geniuses I would read in textbooks had all died from hundreds to thirty years ago. Stephen Hawking though- one of the world's greatest minds- and I had the honor to have lived in his world.

I think the next few years in space exploration will do him proud, and I'm sure we will all wish he could stay to see them. 

I'm shocked 

Rest In Peace.

"One of the most impressive achievements of human technology in recorded history is about to be put in a stranglehold by the same dirtbags who bundle infomercial channels in place of real content on TV that you pay for (Looking at you, DirecTV), and then want to charge extra to include channels that people will actually watch.

EDIT: if you all are calling as fast as you're replying we are going to make a statement!

Here is a script from, ahem, u/poop_standing_up my autocorrect is forever tainted...

Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.

Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. 

Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.",positive,2
"What makes this really depressing is that major tech groups like Google, Amazon, Reddit itself don't have splash messages on their front pages like they did with SOPA. Their silence speaks volumes on how much they don't care about it at all.

This is already a foregone conclusion.


EDIT:  Okay, I did not expect this comment to pick up the steam as is, so to update. Is this a foregone conclusion? Maybe. More likely than not, considering that the vote will be down by five people, two leaning on voting to keep Net Neutrality (I believe they are Rosenworcel and Clyburn, both Democrats) with the remaining three wanting to vote to repeal Net Neutrality:  https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership

Call or write to your representative(s) to remind them that Net Neutrality needs to stay and that they should talk to the FCC about it. Message (or vent to) the FCC leadership that Net Neutrality must stay.

Regardless of the outcome in December, it was nice to know you all.",positive,2

"And this is why we need to fight for an open, free internet. 

Rules I like to follow :

• Always use a VPN (/r/Nologsvpn). This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling. 

• Keep your social media usage as little as possible.

• Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. 

• Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.



If anyone has any extras please share! :)
